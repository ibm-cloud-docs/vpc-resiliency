IBM Cloud Virtual Private Cloud infrastructure and network services support multi-zone and multi-region deployment architectures for high availability and disaster recovery.

VPC Load balancers are used to distribute traffic across multiple zones within a region and support highly available configurations. There are two types of VPC Load Balancers:

-   Application Load Balancers (ALB): provide layer 4 and layer 7 load balancing, support SSL offloading and are recommended for web-based workloads.

-   Network Load Balancers: provide layer 4 load balancing and supports Source IP Preservation and Direct Server Return. It is recommended for workloads that require low latency and high data throughput.

The following table shows a comparison of these Load Balancers.

The Cloud Internet Service (CIS) provides a Global Load Balancer that can distribute traffic on the public network across availability zones within a region in a multi-zone deployment or across multiple regions in a multi-region deployment.

In active-active DR deployments, use IBM Cloud Internet Services (CIS) to reduce network latency for application users in different geographies. Define location-based pools and configure CIS to redirect users to the closest VPC load balancer based on the geographical location of the user requests.

CIS can also be configured as a proxy to a VPC Application Load Balancer in multi-zone or multi-region deployments to leverage CIS application security capabilities such as Web Application Firewall (WAF) and DDoS protection. See [Proxying DNS records and global load balancers](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cis?topic=cis-dns-concepts#dns-concepts-proxying-dns-records) for details.
